//Assignment Operators are

//assignment operator, character is equal sign
let r = 5;

//addition assignment operator, characters are addiion sign and euqals
r = r + 1;
r += 1;

//subtraction assignment
r = r - 1;
r -= 1;

//multiplication assignment
r = r * 1;
r *= 1;

//division assignment
r = r / 1;
r /= 1;

//remainder(modulous) assignment, only returns remainder of division problem
r = r % 1;
r %= 1;

//exponential assignment, exponentially multiplies value to itself
r = r ** 1;
r **= 1;
